## This Repository Contents Assessment of The Moons Dev 

### I choose to fragment both the functionality into a custom hook and the UI into selective components because it allows for better code organization, reusability, and readability.

### By creating a custom hook for the functionality, I can encapsulate the logic related to burning tokens in a single place. This makes it easier to reuse this functionality throughout the application without duplicating code. It also allows for better separation of concerns, as the hook is responsible for handling the burn process independently.

### Similarly, fragmenting the UI into selective components enhances readability and maintainability. Each component can focus on a specific aspect of the UI, such as the burn button bar, stats container, transaction table, etc. This modular approach makes it easier to understand the structure of the UI and locate specific parts when making changes or debugging.
